sbt-assembly
============

*Deploy fat JARs. Restart processes.*

sbt-assembly is a sbt 0.10+ port of an awesome sbt plugin by codahale:

> assembly-sbt is a [simple-build-tool](http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/)
plugin for building a single JAR file of your project which includes all of its
dependencies, allowing to deploy the damn thing as a single file without dicking
around with shell scripts and lib directories or, worse, welding your
configuration to your deployable in the form of a WAR file.

Requirements
------------

* Simple Build Tool
* The burning desire to have a simple deploy procedure.

Using Published Plugin
----------------------

For sbt 0.12.x add sbt-assembly as a dependency in `project/plugins.sbt`:

```scala
addSbtPlugin("com.eed3si9n" % "sbt-assembly" % "0.8.8")
```

Using Source Dependency
-----------------------

Alternately, you can have sbt checkout and build the plugin's source from version control.

Specify sbt-assembly.git as a dependency in `project/project/build.scala`:

```scala
import sbt._

object Plugins extends Build {
  lazy val root = Project("root", file(".")) dependsOn(
    uri("git://github.com/sbt/sbt-assembly.git#XX") // where XX is tag or sha1
  )
}
```

(You may need to check this project's tags to see what the most recent release
is. I'm notoriously crap about updating the version numbers in my READMEs.)

Applying the Plugin to a Project (Adding the `assembly` Task)
-------------------------------------------------------------

First, make sure that you've added the plugin to your build (either the published
builds or source from Git).


If you're using `build.sbt` add this:

```scala
import AssemblyKeys._ // put this at the top of the file

assemblySettings
```

If you are using `build.scala`:

```scala
import sbt._
import Keys._
import sbtassembly.Plugin._
import AssemblyKeys._

object Builds extends Build {
  lazy val buildSettings = Defaults.defaultSettings ++ Seq(
    version := "0.1-SNAPSHOT",
    organization := "com.example",
    scalaVersion := "2.10.1"
  )

  lazy val app = Project("app", file("app"),
    settings = buildSettings ++ assemblySettings) settings(
      // your settings here
    )
}
```

Note: Due to [SI-3488](https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-3488), you have to put your settings in `settings(...)` method esp. if you rewire `mergeStrategy`. 

Now you'll have an awesome new `assembly` task which will compile your project,
run your tests, and then pack your class files and all your dependencies into a
single JAR file: `target/scala_X.X.X/projectname-assembly-X.X.X.jar`.

    > assembly

If you specify a `mainClass in assembly` in build.sbt (or just let it autodetect
one) then you'll end up with a fully executable JAR, ready to rock.

Here is the list of the keys you can rewire for `assembly` task.

    target                        assembly-jar-name             test
    assembly-option               main-class                    full-classpath
    dependency-classpath          assembly-excluded-files       assembly-excluded-jars

For example the name of the jar can be set as follows in build.sbt:

```scala
jarName in assembly := "something.jar"
```

To skip the test during assembly,

```scala
test in assembly := {}
```

To exclude Scala library,

```scala
assembleArtifact in packageScala := false
```

To exclude the class files from the main sources,

```scala
assembleArtifact in packageBin := false
```

To exclude some jar file, first consider using `"provided"` dependency. The dependency will be part of compilation, but excluded from the runtime. Next, try creating a custom configuration that describes your classpath. If all efforts fail, here's a way to exclude jars:

```scala
excludedJars in assembly <<= (fullClasspath in assembly) map { cp => 
  cp filter {_.data.getName == "compile-0.1.0.jar"}
}
```

To exclude specific files, customize merge strategy.

To make a jar containing only the dependencies, type

    > assembly-package-dependency

To set an explicit main class,

```scala
mainClass in assembly := Some("com.example.Main")
```

Merge Strategy
--------------

If multiple files share the same relative path (e.g. a resource named
`application.conf` in multiple dependency JARs), the default strategy is to
verify that all candidates have the same contents and error out otherwise.
This behavior can be configured on a per-path basis using either one
of the following built-in strategies or writing a custom one:

* `MergeStrategy.deduplicate` is the default described above
* `MergeStrategy.first` picks the first of the matching files in classpath order
* `MergeStrategy.last` picks the last one
* `MergeStrategy.singleOrError` bails out with an error message on conflict
* `MergeStrategy.concat` simply concatenates all matching files and includes the result
* `MergeStrategy.filterDistinctLines` also concatenates, but leaves out duplicates along the way
* `MergeStrategy.rename` renames the files originating from jar files
* `MergeStrategy.discard` simply discards matching files

The mapping of path names to merge strategies is done via the setting
`assembly-merge-strategy` which can be augmented like so:

```scala
mergeStrategy in assembly <<= (mergeStrategy in assembly) { (old) =>
  {
    case PathList("javax", "servlet", xs @ _*) => MergeStrategy.first
    case "application.conf" => MergeStrategy.concat
    case "unwanted.txt"     => MergeStrategy.discard
    case x => old(x)
  }
}
```

By the way, the first case pattern in the above using `PathList(...)` is how you can pick `javax/servlet/*` from the first jar. If the default `MergeStrategy.deduplicate` is not working for you, that likely means you have multiple versions of some library pulled by your dependency graph. The real solution is to fix that dependency graph. You can work around it by `MergeStrategy.first` but don't be surprised when you see `ClassNotFoundException`.

Here is the default:

```scala
mergeStrategy in assembly := { 
  case "reference.conf" =>
    MergeStrategy.concat
  case PathList(ps @ _*) if isReadme(ps.last) || isLicenseFile(ps.last) =>
    MergeStrategy.rename
  case PathList("META-INF", xs @ _*) =>
    (xs map {_.toLowerCase}) match {
      case ("manifest.mf" :: Nil) | ("index.list" :: Nil) | ("dependencies" :: Nil) =>
        MergeStrategy.discard
      case ps @ (x :: xs) if ps.last.endsWith(".sf") || ps.last.endsWith(".dsa") =>
        MergeStrategy.discard
      case "plexus" :: xs =>
        MergeStrategy.discard
      case "services" :: xs =>
        MergeStrategy.filterDistinctLines
      case ("spring.schemas" :: Nil) | ("spring.handlers" :: Nil) =>
        MergeStrategy.filterDistinctLines
      case _ => MergeStrategy.deduplicate
    }
  case _ => MergeStrategy.deduplicate
}
```

Custom `MergeStrategy`s can find out where a particular file comes
from using the `sourceOfFileForMerge` method on `sbtassembly.AssemblyUtils`,
which takes the temporary directory and one of the files passed into the
strategy as parameters.

Caching
-------

By default for performance reasons, the result of unzipping any dependency jars to disk is cached from run-to-run. This feature can be disabled by setting

```scala
assemblyCacheUnzip in assembly := false
```

If you wish to cache the fat JAR so its timestamp changes only when the input changes, set the following setting:

```scala
assemblyCacheOutput in assembly := true
```

This feature requires checking the SHA-1 hash of all *.class files, and the hash of all dependency *.jar files. If there are a large number of class files, this could take a long time, although with hashing of jar files, rather than their contents, the speed has recently been [improved](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-assembly/issues/68).

Publishing
----------

If you wish to publish your assembled artifact along with the `publish` task
and all of the other artifacts, you can add an `assembly` classifier (or other):

```scala
artifact in (Compile, assembly) ~= { art =>
  art.copy(`classifier` = Some("assembly"))
}

addArtifact(artifact in (Compile, assembly), assembly)
```

-----------------

Please use [global .gitignore](http://help.github.com/ignore-files/) instead of adding editor junk files to `.gitignore`.
